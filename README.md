# python-course-exercises

this repository basically contains some sample modules I have built myself for fun and some of the assignments 
I had to do in my first ever programming course,
intro to python at columbia university. I loved it and it spurred me on to pursue programming.
If you find anythin useful to you, feel free to use :)
